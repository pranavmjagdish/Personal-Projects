## Analysis Conducted 

### Most Global Show/Film

A show/film has been called most global if it's been in the top 10 list for the most amount of countries.  
The category from the GlobalTop10 list has been brought in through a LEFT OUTER JOIN to help give better context 

There are 5 shows that have been in the top 10 lists for all 94 countries! 

### Endured Popularity 

A show is said to have been popular for the longest duration if it's been in the top 10 lists longest. 
Please Note : A show can be popular for very long in one country than be popular for shorter duration in multiple countries

Many regional shows like Crash Landing On You have featured on this list due to regional popularity dominating

### Most Binged Show/Film 

A show is said to have been most binged if it has the highest amount of watch hours globally.  

As expected, TV shows have been watched for longer than films. This shows that rewatch capacity for films are quite less compared to watching long T.V shows.


## Some Cool Findings

- **Squid Game Popularity :** With only one season, Squid Game had the most amount of watch hours globally during the time period analysed. What's more impressive is that it's beaten shows like Money Heist(5 seasons) and You(3 seasons) by watch time!

- **English vs Non-English content:** Apart from Squid Game, there are no shows that are trending worldwide (present in top 10 lists across all the 94 countries) which are English in origin. This shows that regional content or non-English shows are yet to be globally popular.
